# JuteBag

JuteBag is a simple shopping list application and playground for microservice
/ web development.

# NOTE - PLAYGROUND PROJECT

For all visitors - feel free to look around, but please apologise all those horror that will come over you reading the code - currently it's a playground to get familiar with web development for me - far, far away from any production!

### Why such ugly commits to master?

I want to force myself to keep that project going, so I'll commit every time I have something new. Currently it's a toy project. Once MVP state is achieved (measured by "I used it instead of paper"), development will take place in with proper branching.

## starting the server

Currently, the best way to start the server is using gradle:
./gradlew run
